# bi9bos.github.io

I am still working on the site to make it more appealing and updated. 
There is still a lot to commit. 

As per what I've done, I used mostly HTML and CSS with very little JavaScript coming up in a few days
It's completely mobile-first responsive.

# I won't mind you pointing out my mistake or mistakes, am here to !earn as well...
